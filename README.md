# bot.zen @ EmpiriST 2015 - A minimally-deep learning PoS-tagger (trained for German CMC and Web data)

# Abstract

This article describes the system that participated in the Part-of-speech
tagging subtask of the "EmpiriST 2015 shared task on automatic linguistic
annotation of computer-mediated communication / social media".

The system combines a small assertion of trending techniques, which implement
matured methods, from NLP and ML to achieve competitive results on PoS tagging
of German CMC and Web corpus data; in particular, the system uses word
embeddings and character-level representations of word beginnings and endings
in a LSTM RNN architecture.  Labelled data (Tiger v2.2 and EmpiriST) and
unlabelled data (German Wikipedia) were used for training.
